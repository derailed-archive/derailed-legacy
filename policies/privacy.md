# 1: Introduction

Welcome! This is the policy at Derailed ensuring legal protection of your privacy on our platform.

To give a small introduction, Derailed is a free and open communications platform supporting text and soon voice.
We have mobile, web, and desktop apps all giving the same privacy guarantees put here.

Derailed allows users to create communities called "Guilds," which can hold other users and let them talk between each other.

We aim to provide the maximum amount of feasible and scalable privacy with the minimum amount of annoyance for users.

We also try to follow COPPA, California Privacy laws, and European Privacy laws such as GDPR, as well as respond to any DMCA request posted to dmca@derailed.one.

"We," "Us," "Our," or other variations and synonyms of these words may refer to Derailed as the organization.

"You," "Your," "User," may refer to you, as in the person reading or accepting this policy.

## 1.1: Updating the Policy

We may update the policy at any time for any reason with or without warning. We will try our best to tell users of changes in advance.

Although, once changes go into effect, you automatically agree to agree to the new version of the policy.

## 2: Accounts

When you create a Derailed account, you agree that we may at any time with or without reason delete your account within at most 90 days.

### 2.1: Account Deletion

We may at any time delete or terminate your account for any reason. If your account is deleted, sensitive data like emails, passwords, usernames, will be deleted after the termination period, which is 90 days.

After these 90 days we will delete sensitive information and give anonymity to non-sensitive data. While your account is active though, you may still delete your non-sensitive data.

### 2.2: Deletion Limitations

While the option for deletion of your account is always present, you may have to do some changes or other such before being able to delete your account. We are hereby allowed to impose these non-permanent limitations under jurisdiction as they can be easily changed and effortlessly contorted.

Firstly, we may not allow a user to delete their account if they own any Guilds, so the user may have to transfer ownership or delete the Guild before account deletion.

Secondly, if the user has support requests or other such they must close them before being able to continue with their accounts deletion.

Finally, we may not allow certain users to delete their account if they have a lasting integration with another service, or if they own a large Guild. In this case, you must contact Derailed itself to transfer ownership, or simply remove such integrations.

If other new limitations are imposed, they shall be automatically embedded into this policy. Any limitation must have a description telling why as to the change.

### 2.3: Account Content

We are not responsible for the content you post on our platform. You are legally responsible for any content, images, video, or other media you post or send.

### 2.4: Information Collected
